Docker is an open-source automated deployment system that delivers applications through minimal 
abstraction containers. A package of dependent applications and required elements are embedded inside 
Docker containers, guaranteeing identical task execution across multiple environments. Microservices 
architecture depends on this consistent behavior because different services operate independently. Merkel 
(2014) explains that Docker achieves rapid application deployment through self-contained units,simplifying 
complex application system management. Docker delivers exceptional resource efficiency, letting hosts 
execute multiple containers simultaneously without imposition from traditional virtual machine overhead 
(Pahl& Lee, 2015).

 Docker, as an open source platform, provides abstraction layers that help the user to use this type of 
virtualization. Due to its design, it offers a convenient way for users to create new 
containers and make applications portable so that other users do not need to deal with 
dependencies (also known as “dependency hell”) but at the same time, they do not 
need to have a virtual machine running the application with all the associated costs
